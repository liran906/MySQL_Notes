# Database security

Database security is critical for protecting sensitive data, ensuring data integrity, and controlling access. This lesson covers key operations such as managing users, changing passwords, and handling privileges, along with best practices.

## **1. User Management**

### **1.1 Creating a User**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Create a new database user with secure login credentials.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Specify the correct host (e.g., `'localhost'`, `127.0.0.1`, `www.certain_domain.com` or `'%'` for any host).
    - Use a strong, complex password to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

### **1.2 Viewing Users**

- **Purpose:**
    
    List existing users in the database.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - In PostgreSQL, use `\du` or query the `pg_catalog.pg_user` table.
    - Regularly review the list of users for unnecessary or outdated accounts.

### **1.3 Dropping a User**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Remove a user from the database when they no longer need access.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    DROP USER 'username'@'host';
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Dropping a user also revokes all of their privileges.
    - Confirm that the user is no longer required before removing them.

### **1.4 Changing Passwords**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Update a user’s password to maintain account security.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    ALTER USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_strong_password';
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Change passwords regularly.
    - Ensure the new password complies with your organization’s security policies.

## **2. Privilege Management**

### **2.1 Granting Privileges**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Allow a user to perform specific actions on a database.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'host';
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Follow the **principle of least privilege**: grant only the permissions required for a user’s role.
    - Specific privileges can be granted on particular tables or the entire database.

### **2.2 Viewing Privileges**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Check which privileges have been assigned to a user.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host';
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Regularly review privileges to ensure they align with current roles and responsibilities.
    - Adjust privileges as needed to tighten security.

### **2.3 Revoking Privileges**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Remove one or more privileges from a user.
    
- **Example (MySQL):**
    
    ```sql
    REVOKE UPDATE ON database_name.* FROM 'username'@'host';
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Use **REVOKE** to restrict access when a user’s role changes or if too many privileges are assigned.
    - Ensure that revoking privileges does not disrupt necessary operations.

## **3. Best Practices in Database Security**

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    
    Grant users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious changes.
    
- **Regular Audits:**
    
    Periodically review user accounts and privileges. Remove or adjust accounts that are no longer needed.
    
- **Strong Password Policies:**
    
    Enforce the use of strong, complex passwords and require regular password changes.
    
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
    
    Enable logging of user activities and security events to detect and respond to suspicious actions promptly.
    
- **Use Secure Connections:**
    
    Ensure that connections to the database are encrypted (e.g., using SSL/TLS) to protect data in transit.
    
- **Separation of Duties:**
    
    Limit administrative privileges and distribute security responsibilities among different users to minimize risk.

## **4. Summary**

- **User Management:**
    - **Create Users:** Use `CREATE USER` with secure passwords and appropriate host restrictions.
    - **View Users:** Query system tables or use built-in commands to list users.
    - **Drop Users:** Remove obsolete accounts using `DROP USER`.
    - **Change Passwords:** Update passwords regularly with `ALTER USER`.
- **Privilege Management:**
    - **Grant Privileges:** Use `GRANT` to assign necessary permissions.
    - **View Privileges:** Use `SHOW GRANTS` to audit user rights.
    - **Revoke Privileges:** Use `REVOKE` to remove excess permissions.
- **Best Practices:**
Follow the principle of least privilege, enforce strong password policies, regularly audit user and privilege settings, and ensure secure, encrypted connections.

By implementing these best practices and commands, you can strengthen your database’s security posture and protect critical data from unauthorized access.
